# Pixelator

## Make pixel art and download it.

### A user can choose between 3 canvas sizes (favicon, landscape, or portrait), draw pixel art on them, and download them as a PNG or JPG. This website is perfect if you want to create a unique, pixel favicon for your next project. 

### This project was created using Javascipt, React, and SCSS. 

### You start out with an empty canvas and have 3 sizes to choose from. My favorite size is the favicon size. I use this to make my personalized favicons for my project.

### Once you have your desired canvas size you can start creating your masterpiece and then download it when you're finished.
